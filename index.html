    <h2>Developed & Coded Projects</h2>
    <div class="project-note">
      The projects listed below were personally designed and developed by me.
      They are independent implementations and not systems delivered or owned
      as part of my Systems Analyst responsibilities within employer
      organizations.

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Project 1: Internal Infrastructure & Access Management Portal</h3>
      <p>
        Developed an internal enterprise website hosted on IIS with a
        PowerShell-based backend to provide centralized visibility into
        infrastructure and access management.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution delivers reporting on Microsoft Teams and Active Directory
        group access, server inventory, system uptime, patch and hotfix status,
        and includes standardized SDLC templates and documented processes to
        support operational consistency and compliance.

    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Project 2: Character-Based Systems & Access Validation Tool</h3>
      <p>
        Built a lightweight, character-based user interface tool using batch
        scripting to support rapid validation of systems, user, and vendor
        account information across remote servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool performs checks on vendor and user accounts, Active Directory
        group membership, server specifications, hardware models, uptime status,
        active user login sessions, and badge number validation.
